# These instructions assume that 
# 1) There is a well-known docker host.
# 2) the docker images for the sut and test driver have been pushed to a repository OR have been built/installed directly on the target docker host.
# 3) The following two environment variables are set
#   ELASTICSEARCH_IP
#   EXECUTION_ID

Copy the docker-compose.yml file to the target system - e.g /tmp/docker-compose.yml
# This command will deploy and start the containers:
docker-compose up -d

docker-compose exec test /test/runTests.sh

# Now shutdown the test harness
docker-compose stop

# If you want to completely clean up
docker-compose down
